This code takes as input the columnvalue (j), values of the shortest path of
each of the metabolites (given as a list) and the sum that has to be obtained
using these combination of numbers

For instance, if the column value is 7, the number of imputs is 2,
and the shortest path of the metabolites is 4,3 respectively, and the maximum
sum that has to be obtained is 8, then

>>> generate_partitions(7,[4,3],8)
[(4, 4), (5, 3)]

>>> generate_partitions(4, [2,1,1], 5)
[(2, 1, 2), (2, 2, 1), (3, 1, 1)]
